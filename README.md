In this Assignment, I will practice implementing button via the Bootstrap 3 library.

## How to Run this Project

 1. Download and Install Node.js version 8.10 or higher. The Node.js will also install npm tool.
 2. Once you have installed Node.js and npm, download the source code from GitHub.com
 3. Go to the root of the source code folder and type this in command below. Use
Terminal if your using Mac/Linux or if your using Windows use the Command Prompt.


## Development server 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
